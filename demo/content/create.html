<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>The first screen that loads is comprised of two fields that allows you to create a new post.</p>

<p>The Title field is a simple input field.</p>
<p>The Description field is managed by TinyMCE.</p>

<p>The /src/xxx/xxx.js file contains both an input and a textarea fields.  Calling  tinymce.init() causes TinyMCE to appear. Configuration of TinyMCE is done by passing a simple JavaScript object.</p>

<p>The selector element is the only required element in the configuration object. This configuration option tells TinyMCE which element(s) on the page to replace with TinyMCE.</p>

<p>Entering content into the Title and Description fields and pressing enter creates a new piece of content. Click the save button.</p>
