    <h2>(Optional) Business User Spotlight: Pasting Microsoft Word Content into TinyMCE</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/powerpaste/">PowerPaste</a> bridges the gap between technical and non-technical users when migrating content from Microsoft Word to TinyMCE enabled application. Non-technical users appreciate the preservation of Microsoft Word’s advanced formatting option while developers appreciate clean and valid HTML.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Open the Word document included with the example micro-blogging application located <span class="example">/extras/xxx/PowerPasteSample.doc</span> with Microsoft Word.</li>
        <li>Select the entire document (CTRL+A or CMD+A) and paste the content into the editor (CTRL+C or CMD+C).</li>
        <li>Note how the structure of the content from headings, lists, tables and images remains the same in the micro-blog application while the discrete formatting (fonts, colors, etc) was removed!  This is the “clean” mode for PowerPaste and makes it easy for you to get content into your application from Word while maintaining a consistent look and feel across all created content.</li>
    </ol>
